# Part 1 of assignment
# Setting two variables for f-string 
pet_type = "basset hound"
pet_name = "EZ"
print (f"I have a {pet_type} and their name is {pet_name}.")
print (f"   ")

# Part 2 of assignment
# Setting initial variables and values
name = "Jamison"
savings = "1000"

# x = initial value
x = 18

print (f"Hello {name}. You are currently {x} years old.")

# Add 10 to x
x += 10

print (f"In ten years you will be {x} years old.")

# Then created variables for values I wanted to be multiplied
a = 1000
b = 5
results = a * b

print (f"If you save {savings} dollar for 5 years, you will then have {results} dollars.")

# Divide the initial savings number by number of months to get the average monthly savings
numerator = 1000
denominator = 12
result = numerator / denominator

print (f"Your average monthly saving are $ {result}.")
print (f"    ")

# Part 3 of assignment
# Created variables of current montha and adys in it
# Created letter variables to calculate the seconds in January
month = "January"
days = "31"
a = 31
b = 24
c = 60
d = 60
results = a * b * c * d

print (f"In {month} there are {days} days. That means that there are {results} seconds in {month}.")
print (f"    ")

# Part 4 of assignment
# User inputs any number which then becomes 'num_1'
# 'num_1' then gets floor divided (//) by a dozen
# '%' then finds the remainder
user_input = input(f"Please enter a number: ")

num_1 = int(user_input)
num_2 = 12
num_3 = num_1 // num_2
num_4 = num_1 % num_2

print (f"If you have {num_1} eggs, you'd have {num_3} dozen eggs and have {num_4} eggs left.")
